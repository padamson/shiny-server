This repo contains the setup of [my Shiny server](http://dataprone.info/shiny/).  It is a git repo under `/srv/shiny-server` on my server.

To learn how you can get your own Shiny Server in a similar way, [read Dean Attali's tutorial about how to set up Shiny server](http://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/).

Shiny servers can host Shiny apps and R markdown documents.

The [config](./config) directory contains a few configuration files that are used on the server.
